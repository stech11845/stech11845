Hi there! You stumbled across my GitHub account. This README shows everything I do in short detail, and a bit more.
## Languages
HTML 5, Some CSS
## Why I created this account?
For the following reasons:
- I like to clean up repos
- I like to improve documentation
- And make my own projects!
## I'm hardly working on
[Paintless](https://github.com/stech11845/Paintless), Build and Test (no repos yet)
